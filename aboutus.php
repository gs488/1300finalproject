        <br/>
        Since the acquisition of 416 Eddy Street, Jung Mi Choi,
        the owner of Miyake, has renovated the restaurant to create a warm, romantic,
        and elegant atmosphere. Customers ranging from classy clientele to college
        professors and students can all feel at home in the comforting environment of
        Miyake. We strived to offer a wide variety of asian cuisine at our restaurant with many
        different specials throughout the week so that customers can get a delicious
        meal at an affordable price. This is perfect for the Cornell student that
        lives in Collegetown that is looking for something to eat for lunch and dinner.
        A popular deal among our customers is the Tuesday Special rolls that are at a
        discounted price. Check the Specials page for more details on our specials.
        We encourage you to come visit Miyake and try the food for yourself!</p>

        <span class="history">About Our Menu</span>
        <br/>
        The majority of Miyake's menu incorporates traditional
        Japanese cuisine. However, to serve a broader range of customers, Miyake
        also provides a large selection of food that can only be described as a
        fusion between modern and traditional Japanese cuisine. We have our classic
        sushi that is a culinary highlight with our customers. They come in wide variety
        of preparation and ingredients, ranging from deep fried to using fresh eel. We
        also have delicious bento boxes that offer a familiar, home-like meal with plenty
        of variety to satisfy all our different tastes in one meal. The warm and savory
        Udon noodles is the perfect dish for the cold Ithaca winters. For anyone feeling
        adventurous or reminiscent, there is always something on the menu that is
        guaranteed to satisfy your tastes.</p>
